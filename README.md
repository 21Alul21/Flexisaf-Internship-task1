# Flexisaf intenship task 2

## Project Description

This task entails creating database schemas and entity relationship diagrams (ERDs)
for a website. 

The website I chosed for this task is a mini-banking web site

The technology I used to create the ERDs for this project is the drawsql website
 
## Approach
I visited the [drawsql](https://drawsql.app/teams/augustines-team-1/diagrams/mini-bank-app) website, from there I was able to create the ERD for the website.

The key takeaways from this project are:
- In-depth knowledge about different relationships in a 
relational database.

- Data types for database columns.

- Functional planning and architecting of a database for a website.
